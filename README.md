# 🎨 Art with an Algorithm — Portfolio of Soumya Basuli

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio, a digital space where **art meets logic**.  
I’m **Soumya Basuli**, a Full Stack Developer and Designer who believes creativity should be engineered with purpose.  
This portfolio brings together **retro aesthetics**, **futuristic design**, and **intelligent interactivity** — because even pixels should make sense.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a reflection of my design–tech philosophy:

> “Every creative choice should have logic. Every line of code should feel like design.”

The portfolio is a **dynamic, scroll-driven experience** built to showcase my work across web development, design, 3D modeling, and AI experimentation — from retro-inspired websites to functional product concepts and UI/UX prototypes.
